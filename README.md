# Smart Waste Sorting System using Image Processing

## Description
As the global population continues to grow and environmental concerns become increasingly urgent, effective waste management has emerged as a critical challenge. The Smart Waste Sorting System offers an innovative solution designed to address these challenges by leveraging advanced machine learning and computer vision technologies. This project focuses on automating the classification and sorting of waste into three primary categories: recyclable, compostable, and landfill.

The system utilizes a range of sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presented in the design and algorithm chapter, including ResNet50, MobileNet V3 (Large & Small), EfficientNet B0, and MobileNet V2, all implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework. These models are trained on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle is shown in the dataset chapter, which provides a diverse array of images representing the various waste categories. The Adam Optimizer from the optimization techniques chapter is employed to enhance model performance by dynamically adjusting learning rates, thereby improving accuracy and accelerating convergence. The training process aims to minimize cross-entropy loss, ensuring precise classification.
